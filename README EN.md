# **Pixic** - a Pixilang compiler.
[**Pixilang**](http://warmplace.ru/soft/pixilang) is very convinient programming language. You can easily and quickly make a graphical program or demoscene using this language. But it has low performance because of bytecode interpretation.\
With **Pixic** you can compile code written in Pixilang programming language! Firstly Pixic translates Pixilang code into C language, then translated code compiles into **native code**.\
Performance of the Pixilang code compiled by Pixic increases above **2** times!\
Pixic is fully compatible with the official version of Pixilang.
* **Speed is a benefit of free Pixilang programs!** Only free programs can be compiled with Pixic and run because *Pixic runtime* library reqired for that is distributed under the terms of the not Lesser but normal **GNU General Public License**. Other programs can use an official Pixilang interpreter.

*Enjoy pixi-experiments.*\
